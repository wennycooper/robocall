;
; SIP Configuration example for Asterisk
;
; Note: Please read the security documentation for Asterisk in order to
; 	understand the risks of installing Asterisk with the sample
;	configuration. If your Asterisk is installed on a public
;	IP address connected to the Internet, you will want to learn
;	about the various security settings BEFORE you start
;	Asterisk. 
;
;	Especially note the following settings:
;		- allowguest (default enabled)
;		- permit/deny/acl - IP address filters
;		- contactpermit/contactdeny/contactacl - IP address filters for registrations
;		- context - Which set of services you offer various users
;
; SIP dial strings
;-----------------------------------------------------------
; In the dialplan (extensions.conf) you can use several
; syntaxes for dialing SIP devices.
;        SIP/devicename
;        SIP/username@domain   (SIP uri)
;        SIP/username[:password[:md5secret[:authname[:transport]]]]@host[:port]
;        SIP/devicename/extension
;        SIP/devicename/extension/IPorHost
;        SIP/username@domain//IPorHost
;
;
; Devicename
;        devicename is defined as a peer in a section below.
;
; username@domain
;        Call any SIP user on the Internet
;        (Don't forget to enable DNS SRV records if you want to use this)
;
; devicename/extension
;        If you define a SIP proxy as a peer below, you may call
;        SIP/proxyhostname/user or SIP/user@proxyhostname
;        where the proxyhostname is defined in a section below
;        This syntax also works with ATA's with FXO ports
;
; SIP/username[:password[:md5secret[:authname]]]@host[:port]
;        This form allows you to specify password or md5secret and authname
;        without altering any authentication data in config.
;        Examples:
;
;        SIP/*98@mysipproxy
;        SIP/sales:topsecret::account02@domain.com:5062
;        SIP/12345678::bc53f0ba8ceb1ded2b70e05c3f91de4f:myname@192.168.0.1
;
; IPorHost
;        The next server for this call regardless of domain/peer
;
; All of these dial strings specify the SIP request URI.
; In addition, you can specify a specific To: header by adding an
; exclamation mark after the dial string, like
;
;         SIP/sales@mysipproxy!sales@edvina.net
;
; A new feature for 1.8 allows one to specify a host or IP address to use
; when routing the call. This is typically used in tandem with func_srv if
; multiple methods of reaching the same domain exist. The host or IP address
; is specified after the third slash in the dialstring. Examples:
;
; SIP/devicename/extension/IPorHost
; SIP/username@domain//IPorHost
;
; CLI Commands
; -------------------------------------------------------------
; Useful CLI commands to check peers/users:
;   sip show peers               Show all SIP peers (including friends)
;   sip show registry            Show status of hosts we register with
;
;   sip set debug on             Show all SIP messages
;
;   sip reload                   Reload configuration file
;   sip show settings            Show the current channel configuration
;
;------- Naming devices ------------------------------------------------------
;
; When naming devices, make sure you understand how Asterisk matches calls
; that come in.
;	1. Asterisk checks the SIP From: address username and matches against
;	   names of devices with type=user
;	   The name is the text between square brackets [name]
;	2. Asterisk checks the From: addres and matches the list of devices
;	   with a type=peer
;	3. Asterisk checks the IP address (and port number) that the INVITE
;	   was sent from and matches against any devices with type=peer
;
; Don't mix extensions with the names of the devices. Devices need a unique
; name. The device name is *not* used as phone numbers. Phone numbers are
; anything you declare as an extension in the dialplan (extensions.conf).
;
; When setting up trunks, make sure there's no risk that any From: username
; (caller ID) will match any of your device names, because then Asterisk
; might match the wrong device.
;
; Note: The parameter "username" is not the username and in most cases is
;       not needed at all. Check below. In later releases, it's renamed
;       to "defaultuser" which is a better name, since it is used in
;       combination with the "defaultip" setting.
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ** Old configuration options **
; The "call-limit" configuation option is considered old is replaced
; by new functionality. To enable callcounters, you use the new 
; "callcounter" setting (for extension states in queue and subscriptions)
; You are encouraged to use the dialplan groupcount functionality
; to enforce call limits instead of using this channel-specific method.
; You can still set limits per device in sip.conf or in a database by using
; "setvar" to set variables that can be used in the dialplan for various limits.

[general]
context=default                 ; Default context for incoming calls. Defaults to 'default'

[6001]
  type=friend
  context=from-internal
  host=dynamic
  secret=unsecurepassword
  disallow=all
  allow=ulaw
